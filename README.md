one-offs
========

A collection of small scripts.

ccnp.py - Find filenames and glue them together with a url, outputs a wget list.

nmap-web-headers.py - List web headers from a nmap scan, usage "nmap-web-headers.py inlog outfile"

pcast.py - Downloads podcasts from rss feed, checks to see if it exists first.

pcast_win.py - Windows version, one day I'll get around to merging them

dload.py - simple downloader
